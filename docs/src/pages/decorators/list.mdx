Using decorators is a very clear way to describe your entities an can be used in many means. For example : how
properties are exposed, validated, which have dedicated endpoints, etc.

Although we heavily rely on the use of decorators with `entity-routes`, there are only 8 built-in decorators right now,
and you should mostly just use the first three here :

| Definition                                 | Kind                                | Description-                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Learn more                                              |
