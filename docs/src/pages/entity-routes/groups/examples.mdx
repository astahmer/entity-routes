### Basic operations

Given a `User` entity described here.

```typescript
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: ["create", "update", "details", "list", "delete"] })
@Entity()
export class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Column()
    birthDate: Date;

    @Column()
    email: string;
}
```

Let's say we want to expose the user name through basic [`CRUD_OPERATIONS`](/definitions#const-crud_operations) for any
context.

```typescript {2}
class User {
    @Groups("basic")
    name: string;
}
```

But we would also like to expose it for any [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope), on a custom
[**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/) _(which is matching a custom route action with the same
[**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/))_.

```typescript {4,10}
// You could decorate it with another @Groups
class User {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Groups(["admin_custom"])
    name: string;
}

// or write all the operations yourself and get the same result
class User {
    @Groups(["create", "update", "list", "details", "admin_custom"])
    name: string;
}
```

And finally, we want to expose it precisely on the article context on customList
[**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/).

```typescript {4,10}
// You can just decorate it with yet another @Groups, you get the idea.
class User {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Groups(["admin_custom"])
    @Groups({ article: ["customList"] })
    name: string;
}
```

### Relations

### IRI

Given a `User` entity described here.

```typescript
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: ["create", "update", "details", "list", "delete"] })
@Entity()
export class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @ManyToOne(() => Role)
    role: Role;
}
```

And a `Role` entity described here.

```typescript
@EntityRoute()
@Entity()
export class Role extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    title: string;
}
```

[Remember](/entity-routes/introduction#1-creating-your-entities), since every entities should extend from the
GenericEntity interface and always have the `id` property exposed, you can expose your relations IRI by just decorating
the relation with `@Groups` on the parent entity.

```typescript {2}
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @ManyToOne(() => Role)
    role: Role;
}
```

If no other properties than `id` are exposed on role for the user.details `route scope`, you will end up with a response
such as :

```json {8}
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex",
    "role": "/api/role/1"
}
```

### Nested property

To expose a nested property, you need to decorate with [`@Groups`](/definitions#groups) both the relation (on the parent
entity) and the property (of the relation) with the same `route scope`.

For this example, let's expose the user's role.title property for the details route (`GET:/user/xxx` route).

```typescript {2}
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @ManyToOne(() => Role)
    role: Role;
}
```

```typescript {2}
class Role extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Column()
    title: string;
}
```

That's it ! The user details route (`GET:/user/1`) will contain a role object with a title property inside :

```json {8-11}
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex",
    "role": {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Admin"
    }
}
```

This works the exact same way with a property that is a collection
([`OneToMany`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-one-one-to-many-relations)/[`ManyToMany`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-many-relations))
instead of a single relation
([`OneToOne`](https://typeorm.io/#/one-to-one-relations)/[`ManyToOne`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-one-one-to-many-relations)).

Still, for the sake of it let's have an example using User/Articles entities. Let's expose the user's articles.title
property for the list route (`GET:/user/xxx` route).

```typescript {2}
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}
```

```typescript {2}
class Article extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Column()
    title: string;

    @Column()
    content: string;

    @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.articles)
    author: User;
}
```

And you would end up with this kind of response :

```json {6-11}
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "First article"
        }
    ],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```

Of course, if you hadn't exposed the articles.title property while keeping user.articles exposed, you would only have
the articles IRI returned :

```json {6}
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": ["/api/article/1"],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```
