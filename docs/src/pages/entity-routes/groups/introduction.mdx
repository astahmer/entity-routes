By using the [@Groups](/definitions#groups) decorator, you can expose entity properties through one or more
[`route scopes`](/entity-routes/route-scope/).

That also means that by default, there will be no properties exposed for your entities. This allows you to have
optimized queries by specifiying precisely which properties and relations are selected from the database.

## Definitions

### Operation kind

There are 2 **operation kind** :

-   the `persist` [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) (_create/update_)
-   the `read` [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) (_details/list_)

### Exposed

An "exposed" property has different meaning depending on the **operation kind**.

-   For a `read` [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/), an exposed property will be returned in a route response.
-   For a `persist` [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/), an exposed property value will be upsertable from a
    request body.
-   A custom [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/) is considered both a `read` and `persist`
    [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/)

You can expose a property locally (for an entity [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope) using an object with entity
[`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope) as keys and values as [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) :

```typescript
// The decorated property value will be insertable
// when creating this entity from the POST:/users route
// and also returned in GET:/users/:userId
@Groups({ user: ["create", "details"] })
```

Or you can expose a property globally (for **any** entity [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope) using an array of
[**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) :

```typescript
// The decorated property value will be insertable
// when creating this entity from any POST:/xxx route
// and also returned in any GET:/xxx/:xxxId
@Groups(["create", "details"])
```

<DocAlert status="warning">

On a `persist` operation, any property not exposed through `@Groups` will be ignored.

</DocAlert>

There are also the [shortcuts](operations#shortcuts) `all` and `basic` that you can use directly, or use as a route
scope value.

Below is a summary.

| Groups                                                     | Route Scope                         | Operations for the User route scope      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| @Groups(["create", "details"])                             | All                                 | ["create", "details"]                    |
| @Groups({ user: ["create", "details"], article: ["list"]}) | User(C+D)/Article(L)                | ["create", "details"]                    |
| @Groups("basic")                                           | All                                 | ["create", "update", "details", "list",] |
| @Groups("all")                                             | All                                 | All                                      |
| @Groups({ user: "all", article: ["list"], role: "basic"})  | User(all)/Article(list)/Role(basic) | All                                      |

## Relations IRIs

If you need to expose a nested property of a relation (single or collections), you can just add the same group on both
the relation entity and the nested property wanted.

On the other hand, if you need to retrieve a relation id but no nested property, just decorate the relation with
[`@Groups`](/definitions#groups) and the relation property will have its id (or IRI) as value in the response.

> By default, IRIs, or Internationalized Resource Identifier, are used instead of a simple `id` to clearly identify
> relations. A relation IRI is made with the [`idToIRI`](/definitions#idtoiri) function using the (route path|entity
> table name) & id.

You can opt-out of using IRIs by setting the `useIris` key of [`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions) to
`false`.

[See the example.](/entity-routes/groups/examples#iri)

## Computed property

You can expose methods that will be lazily called them after the entity they belong to has been retrieved.

Prefixing your method's name by `get`|`is`|`has` and then using PascalCase will define the entity key under which the
method's result will be set in the response. If you don't want to use one of these prefix, you can use the 2nd arg of
the `@Groups` decorator to define an `alias` that will be used as entity key in `entity-routes` responses.

### Asynchrone

A `computed property` can be asynchrone, in which case the response will end for the Promise to be done before sending
the response. In case there are multiple async `computed properties`, they will be processed in parallel to keep things
sane, but stil wait for all of them to be done.

> Currently, if `computed property` (both async & sync) somehow throws an error, the error is simply ignored. It is not
> recommended to abuse `computed properties` as it can make responses time slow, especially when working with
> collections.

### With dependencies

There is one caveat though : What if your `computed property` depends on another property that is not exposed (through
`@Groups`) ? You could always just decorate the properties you depend onto with a `@Groups`, but then you will end up
having those properties returned in the response and you might not want that. That's what the [@DependsOn](#depends-on)
decorator is for, selecting needed properties from the database table when the decorated computed property is exposed
without returning them.

### Basic example

```ts
class Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    rights: string[];

    @Groups("all")
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Groups("all", "isAdmin")
    hasAdminRight() {
        return this.rights.includes("admin");
    }
}
```

Here, the `getFullName` accessor will be exposed as `fullName` while the `hasAdminRight` will be displayed as `isAdmin`
in responses.

### Async example

```ts
class Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    rights: string[];

    @Groups("all")
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Groups("all", "isAdmin")
    hasAdminRight() {
        return this.rights.includes("admin");
    }
}
```

### Accessor

Accessors are the special methods
[`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set).

They are treated as properties even though they will not be used for SQL selection.

<DocAlert status="info">

Just like regular methods, you can use the 2nd arg of `@Groups` to define an `alias` if you want your getter to have
another name in your `entity-routes` responses.

</DocAlert>

Using almost the same entity/properties as the [`computed property` basic example](#basic-example).

```ts
class Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    rights: string[];

    @Groups("all")
    get fullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Groups("all", "isAdmin")
    get hasAdminRight() {
        return this.rights.includes("admin");
    }
}
```

Here, the `fullName` accessor will also be exposed as `fullName` while the `hasAdminRight` will be displayed as
`isAdmin` in responses.
