By using the [@Groups](/definitions#groups) decorator, you can expose the decorated property through one or more
[`route scopes`](/entity-routes/route-scope/).

That also means that by default, there will be no properties exposed for your entities. This allows you to have
optimized queries by specifiying precisely which properties and relations are selected from the database.

## Definitions

### Operation kind

There are 2 **operation kind** :

-   the `persist` [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) (_create/update_)
-   the `read` [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) (_details/list_)

### Exposed

An "exposed" property has different meaning depending on the **operation kind**.

-   For a `read` [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/), an exposed property will be returned in a route response.
-   For a `persist` [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/), an exposed property value will be upsertable from a
    request body.
-   A custom [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/) is considered both a `read` and `persist`
    [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/)

You can expose a property locally (for an entity [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope) using an object with entity
[`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope) as keys and values as [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) :

```typescript
// The decorated property value will be insertable
// when creating this entity from the POST:/users route
// and also returned in GET:/users/:userId
@Groups({ user: ["create", "details"] })
```

Or you can expose a property globally (for **any** entity [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope) using an array of
[**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) :

```typescript
// The decorated property value will be insertable
// when creating this entity from any POST:/xxx route
// and also returned in any GET:/xxx/:xxxId
@Groups(["create", "details"])
```

There are also the [shortcuts](operations#shortcuts) `all` and `basic` that you can use directly, or use as a route
scope value.

Below is a summary.

| Groups                                                     | Route Scope                         | Operations for the User route scope      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| @Groups(["create", "details"])                             | All                                 | ["create", "details"]                    |
| @Groups({ user: ["create", "details"], article: ["list"]}) | User(C+D)/Article(L)                | ["create", "details"]                    |
| @Groups("basic")                                           | All                                 | ["create", "update", "details", "list",] |
| @Groups("all")                                             | All                                 | All                                      |
| @Groups({ user: "all", article: ["list"], role: "basic"})  | User(all)/Article(list)/Role(basic) | All                                      |

### Relations IRIs

If you need to expose a nested property of a relation (single or collections), you can just add the same group on both
the relation entity and the nested property wanted.

On the other hand, if you need to retrieve a relation id but no nested property, just decorate the relation with
[`@Groups`](/definitions#groups) and the relation property will have its id (or IRI) as value in the response.

> By default, IRIs, or Internationalized Resource Identifier, are used instead of a simple `id` to clearly identify
> relations. A relation IRI is made with the [`idToIRI`](/definitions#idtoiri) function using the (route path|entity
> table name) & id.

You can opt-out of using IRIs by setting the `useIris` key of [`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions) to
`false`.
