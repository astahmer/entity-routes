## Computed property

You can expose methods that will be lazily called them after the entity they belong to has been retrieved.

Prefixing your method's name by `get`|`is`|`has` and then using PascalCase will define the entity key under which the
method's result will be set in the response. If you don't want to use one of these prefix, you can use the 2nd arg of
the `@Groups` decorator to define an `alias` that will be used as entity key in `entity-routes` responses.

### Asynchrone

A `computed property` can be asynchrone, in which case the response will end for the Promise to be done before sending
the response. In case there are multiple async `computed properties`, they will be processed in parallel to keep things
sane, but stil wait for all of them to be done.

> Currently, if `computed property` (both async & sync) somehow throws an error, the error is simply ignored. It is not
> recommended to abuse `computed properties` as it can make responses time slow, especially when working with
> collections.

### With dependencies

There is one caveat though : What if your `computed property` depends on another property that is not exposed (through
`@Groups`) ? You could always just decorate the properties you depend onto with a `@Groups`, but then you will end up
having those properties returned in the response and you might not want that. That's what the [@DependsOn](#depends-on)
decorator is for, selecting needed properties from the database table when the decorated computed property is exposed
without returning them.

### Basic example

```ts
class Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    rights: string[];

    @Groups("all")
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Groups("all", "isAdmin")
    hasAdminRight() {
        return this.rights.includes("admin");
    }
}
```

Here, the `getFullName` accessor will be exposed as `fullName` while the `hasAdminRight` will be displayed as `isAdmin`
in responses.

### Async example

```ts
class Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    rights: string[];

    @Groups("all")
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Groups("all", "isAdmin")
    hasAdminRight() {
        return this.rights.includes("admin");
    }
}
```

### Accessor

Accessors are the special methods
[`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set).

They are treated as properties even though they will not be used for SQL selection.

<DocAlert status="info">

Just like regular methods, you can use the 2nd arg of `@Groups` to define an `alias` if you want your getter to have
another name in your `entity-routes` responses.

</DocAlert>

Using almost the same entity/properties as the [`computed property` basic example](#basic-example).

```ts
class Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    rights: string[];

    @Groups("all")
    get fullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Groups("all", "isAdmin")
    get hasAdminRight() {
        return this.rights.includes("admin");
    }
}
```

Here, the `fullName` accessor will also be exposed as `fullName` while the `hasAdminRight` will be displayed as
`isAdmin` in responses.
