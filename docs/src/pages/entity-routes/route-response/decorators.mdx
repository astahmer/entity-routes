title: Decorator functions
---

## What problem does it solve ?

When you need to dynamically add attributes to your entity properties recursively (which means **computed properties**
can't meet your needs), maybe depending on the metadata, a concrete example of that case are
[subresources IRIs](/entity-routes/subresources/introduction#format-in-response).

## How

Decorator functions recursively traverse an item to decorate it.

> Each decorator function is added to the pipe of the `Writer`.`fromItem` function.

They get access to `DecorateFnArgs`, among them there is the current item metadata & a clone/ref to update in any way an
item's property (or even completely re-assign the item to another type).

A decorator function can be async and therefore will be awaited before passing the updated item to the next decorator
function.

> You can pass any custom data to the decorator function under the `DecorateFnArgs`.`data` key.

## Usage

[Feel free to check the tests for more use-cases here.](tests/response/Decorator.test.ts)

With these entities :

```ts
// Shortened entity with only relevant parts
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    role: Role;
    articles: Article[];
}

const user = new User();
user.name = "Alex";
user.email = "email@test.com";

const role = new Role();
// [...]
user.role = role;

const article1 = new Article();
// [...]
const article2 = new Article();
// [...]
user.articles = [article1, article2];
```

A very simple decorator function :

```ts
const data = { abc: 123, test: "just testing" };

const decorateFn: DecorateFn<User, typeof data> = (args) => {
    args.clone.testProp = "added_prop";
    for (const key in args.data) {
        args.clone[key] = args.data[key as keyof typeof data];
    }
};
const decorated = await decorator.decorateItem({
    rootItem: user,
    rootMetadata: getRepository(User).metadata,
    data,
    decorateFn,
});
```

The result could look like this :

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex",
    "email": "email@test.com",
    "role": {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Admin",
        "startDate": "2020-10-21T09:15:39.100Z",
        "testProp": "added_prop"
    },
    "articles": [
        { "id": 1, "testProp": "added_prop" },
        { "id": 2, "testProp": "added_prop" }
    ],
    "testProp": "added_prop"
}
```
