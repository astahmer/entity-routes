Each `entity-routes` response will be formated using a template defined by the route
[**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/) , either `list` or `details`. All responses will share the `@context` part
nonetheless. Here the actual ts type ([`GenericRouteResponse`](/definitions#genericrouteresponse)) :

```ts
type GenericRouteResponse = {
    "@context": {
        /** Current route operation */
        operation: string;
        /** Current entity's route */
        entity: string;
        /** Total number of items found for this request */
        totalItems?: number;
        /** Number of items retrieved for this request */
        retrievedItems?: number;
        /** Entity validation errors */
        validationErrors?: EntityErrorResults;
        /** Global response error */
        error?: string;
    };
    /** List of entities */
    items?: any[];
    /** deleted entity id */
    deleted?: any;
    /** Entity props */
    [k: string]: any;
};
```

## @context

-   `operation`/`entity` keys are always added and define the [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope/)
-   On a `persist` [**operation kind**](/groups/introduction#operation-kind), either `create` or `update`, the
    `validationErrors` key will be added and defaults to an empty array.
-   On a `read` [**operation kind**](/groups/introduction#operation-kind), either `list` or `details`, the
    `totalItems`/`retrievedItems` keys will be added and defaults to empty arrays.
-   The `error` key is only added when there is an error, it is populated with the error message caught.

## Auto reload

You can avoid making another request on the entity `details` route (`GET:/xxx/123`) to get the latest recorded state
after an entity was persisted using auto-reloading.

On `persist` operations (`create`/`update`), after the entity was successfully saved, it can be auto-reloaded using the
`shouldAutoReload` key of the [`CreateUpdateOptions`](/definitions#createupdateoptions) object, passed to the
`create`/`update` methods of [`RouteController`](/definitions/classes/routecontroller).

When an entity is auto-reloaded, it is read from the database using the `getDetails` method of
[`RouteController`](/definitions/classes/routecontroller), so that the response is returned the exact same way as if it
was requested through the `details` route (`GET:/xxx/123`). The [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/) used is
either defined explictly by using the `responseOperation` key of the
[`CreateUpdateOptions`](/definitions#createupdateoptions) object, or defaults to `details` elsewise.

> By default, it is enabled since the [`defaultEntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#const-defaultentityrouteoptions) object
> has a `defaultCreateUpdateOptions` key set to `{ shouldAutoReload: true, shouldFormatResult: true }`.
