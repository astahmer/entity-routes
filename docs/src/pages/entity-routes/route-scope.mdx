title: Route Scope
description: It's a unique pair of {entity name}.{operation}.

import { Tab, TabList, TabPanel, TabPanels, Tabs } from "@chakra-ui/react";

Let's start by defining what we call a **route scope**.

It is a unique combination of 2 elements :

-   The route main [entity](https://typeorm.io/#/entities/what-is-entity)
-   An [operation](/entity-routes/operations), for example any of the [C|R|U|D operations](/definitions#groupsoperation)

Each route scope will have unique responses schema generated from the mapping, itself made from the list of exposed
properties on that scope.

## Examples

These are the routes generated from the [Quick start example](/getting-started/quick-start) :

| Verb   | Path                                  | Entity  | Operation | Route scope         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| POST   | /users                                | User    | create    | user.create         |
| POST   | /users/mapping                        | User    | create    | user.create.mapping |
| PUT    | /users/:id(\d+)                       | User    | update    | user.update         |
| PUT    | /users/:id(\d+)/mapping               | User    | update    | user.update.mapping |
| GET    | /users/:id(\d+)                       | User    | get       | user.get            |
| GET    | /users/:id(\d+)/mapping               | User    | get       | user.get.mapping    |
| GET    | /users                                | User    | list      | user.list           |
| GET    | /users/mapping                        | User    | list      | user.list.mapping   |
| DELETE | /users/:id(\d+)                       | User    | delete    | user.delete         |
| POST   | /users/:UserId(\d+)/articles          | Article | create    | article.create      |
| GET    | /users/:UserId(\d+)/articles          | Article | list      | article.list        |
| DELETE | /users/:UserId(\d+)/articles/:id(\d+) | Article | delete    | article.delete      |

<Info>


The route main entity for subresources routes is its relation entity, here it is `Article` and not `User`.

</Info>


### Subresources

This also means that subresources share the same route scope as their property entity router. For example, if you had an
[`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter) set up on the `Article` entity with `["create", "update", "list"]`
[**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/), you would have those routes generated :

| Verb | Path                       | Entity  | Operation | Route scope            |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| POST | /articles                  | Article | create    | article.create         |
| POST | /articles/mapping          | Article | create    | article.create.mapping |
| PUT  | /articles/:id(\d+)         | Article | update    | article.update         |
| PUT  | /articles/:id(\d+)/mapping | Article | update    | article.update.mapping |
| GET  | /articles                  | Article | list      | article.list           |
| GET  | /articles/mapping          | Article | list      | article.list.mapping   |

So, if you need to retrieve a subresource route mapping, it's actually just the subresource entity mapping for the same
operation you're looking for !

## Exposing properties

With the [@Groups](/definitions#groups) decorator you can expose any property ([or method](/groups/computed-property)),
from any entity in the route scope of your choice.

What that means is that you can for example have a different mapping for the `User` **creation** route and the `User`
**update** route. More on that [later](/groups/introduction).

_Of course this also means that you can have differents constraints for each route scope._ TODO Validator docref

## Inferred Mapping

The **mapping** is a description of every properties exposed through the [`@Groups`](/definitions#groups) decorator for
a specific **route scope**.

A route mapping endpoint is auto-generated for every basic [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) and accessible
by adding _"/mapping"_ to the path of the route, the same HTTP verb as the [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/)
it describes is used.

This mapping route will give you the response schema expected on the actual route it describes.

There is a `pretty` query parameter (`?pretty=true`) available to make it less verbose, it makes mapping look kind of
like a GraphQL request body, as you can see below.
