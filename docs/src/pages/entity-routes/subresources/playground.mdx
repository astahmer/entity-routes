import { DocAlert, SubresourcePlayground } from "@/components";

Feel free to play with the playground below to experience how you can configure each subresource and see the route
generation results.

<DocAlert status="warning">

This playground assumes that all subresources will be of the same kind (either collection or single), so that they can
be chained indefinitely.

</DocAlert>

> The routes are intentionnaly not all added initially, you can add them yourself by adding a route using the "+" button
> next to the entity name tags, and then selecting each subresource properties you want in your routes.

<DocAlert status="info">

You can just click on "Generate all possible routes" and see each possibilities for the config defined above. You can
also hover on the warning icon to see the reason why the subresource can not be nested further.

</DocAlert>

These are the possible reason why a subresource won't nest further :

-   has reached max depth from a parent subresource
-   last subresource has no nested subresources
-   last subresource can't have nested subresources
-   that route already exists
