It's a way to generate a dedicated endpoint for an entity property.

Let's say you have a `User` entity that owns a collection of `articles`. Rather than exposing the `articles` in the
`/users` route and have a lot of unnecessary nested data, you might want to directly access the `article` list with only
the properties you want for that [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope).

## Usage

By decorating the `articles` property with the [@Subresource](/definitions#subresource) decorator, you generates 3
routes :

-   `GET:/users/:userId/articles`, which will list all `articles` of the given `user`
-   `POST:/users/:userId/articles`, which will allow you to join an `article` to this `user` (a new `article` is
    inserted if no `article`.id is given !)
-   `DELETE:/users/:userId/articles/:articleId`, which will allow you to remove the relation between the given
    `user`/`article`

Let's implement that :

```typescript {7,11}
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS })
@Entity()
class User {
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    articles: Article[];
}

@EntityRoute()
@Entity()
class Article {
    @Column()
    name: string;
}
```

> For an entity to be used as a Subresource, it **must have an [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter)**
> registered. And if you don't want to generates CRUD routes, you can just provide no arguments to
> [`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) just like the example above.

Of course, you can customize your Subresource using [SubresourceOptions](/definitions#subresourceoptions) as optional
second argument.

| Option key    | Type                                                        | Default                                   | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| operations    | [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation) | `["create", "list", "details", "delete"]` | Defines which routes should be generated for this subresource  |
| maxDepth      | number                                                      | undefined                                 | Restrict the depth of subresources nesting allow from this one |
| canHaveNested | boolean                                                     | true                                      | Allow this subresource to have nested child subresources       |
| canBeNested   | boolean                                                     | true                                      | Allow this subresource to be used as a child subresource       |

<Info>

-   By just specifying "create" as [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation), only the
    `POST:/users/:userId/articles` would be generated. You get the idea, this works the same for others operations.
-   A single relation should use the `details` [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation) whereas a
    collection should use the `list` [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation).

</Info>

## Nesting

Subresources are nestable by default, so you could have a `GET:/users/:userId/articles/comments` by making
`Article.comments` a subresource as well. And if you're crazy enough, nothing stops you from nesting further with a
`GET:/users/:userId/articles/comments/upvotes`, etc.

<Info>

The [`defaultEntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#const-defaultentityrouteoptions) (passed to the
[`makers`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker)) has a `defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl: 2`.

</Info>

### Max depth

You can control the max depth using the maxDepth key of [SubresourceOptions](/definitions#subresourceoptions). Each
maxDepth is independant from each other. If no max depth is defined, it will fallback to the
`defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl` of [`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions), and if somehow no
`defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl` is defined, it will default to 2.

### Circular

Circular subresources are disabled by default. You can allow this behavior using the `allowCircular` key of
[SubresourceOptions](/definitions#subresourceoptions).

> Example: Let's say a `user` has `articles`, these `articles` have both a `writers` (linking back to the `User` entity)
> and also have a `relatedArticles` subresources.

By allowing circular subresources (and with the appropriates max depths configured), the route
`GET:/users/articles/writers` would be generated.

## With single relations

The example above and most use-cases of subresources will be for collection relation
([`OneToMany`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-one-one-to-many-relations)/[`ManyToMany`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-many-relations)).
But sometimes you might want a single relation
([`OneToOne`](https://typeorm.io/#/one-to-one-relations)/[`ManyToOne`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-one-one-to-many-relations))
to be a subresource.

There is actually no difference in usage between single/collection subresources but here's an example for the sake of
it.

Let's say you have a `User` entity that is linked with a `config` relation. Rather than exposing the `config` in the
`/users` route and have a lot of unnecessary nested data, you might want to directly access the config with only the
properties you want for that [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope).

By decorating the `config` property with the [@Subresource](/definitions#subresource) decorator, you generates 3 routes
:

-   `GET:/users/:userId/config`, which will show you the `config` of the given `user`
-   `POST:/users/:userId/config`, which will allow you to join a `config` to this `user` (a new `config` is inserted if
    no `config`.id is given !)
-   `DELETE:/users/:userId/config`, which will allow you to remove the relation between the given `user`/`config`

## Format in response

With the [`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions) key `shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem`, the corresponding
subresources IRI are added for each items having subresources (without exposing them through
[`@Groups`](/definitions#groups)).

<Info>

The [`defaultEntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#const-defaultentityrouteoptions) (passed to the
[`makers`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker)) has a `shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem: true`.

</Info>

### With subresource IRI

Using the same example from above with User/Article, here's how that would look like :

```typescript
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS }, { shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem: true })
@Entity()
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["create", "details"], article: ["list"] })
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}

@EntityRoute()
@Entity()
class Article extends AbstractEntity {
    @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.articles)
    author: User;

    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Column()
    title: string;
}
```

The `articles` property will have its subresource IRI displayed in the responses :

```json {6} bottomLeft="GET:/users/1" bottomRight="The article property is an array of IRI"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": "/api/users/1/articles",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```

### With relation exposed

When exposing the `articles` property on `user.details`, the response will differ :

```ts {5}
// ...
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    // ...

    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}
```

```json {6} bottomLeft="GET:/users/1" bottomRight="The article property is now an array of article IRI"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": ["/api/articles/123"],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```

### With nested property exposed

And if you exposed properties from that subresource relation (with [`@Groups`](/definitions#groups)):

```typescript {3,14}
// ...
class User {
    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}

// ...
class Article extends AbstractEntity {
    @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.articles)
    author: User;

    @Groups({ user: ["details"] })
    @Column()
    title: string;
}
```

This is how the response would look like with `User.articles.title` exposed :

```json {6-11} bottomLeft="GET:/users/1" bottomRight="The article property is an array of object with every nested properties of article exposed"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": [
        {
            "id": 123,
            "title": "First article"
        }
    ],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```

## Metadata

You can retrieve the [`RouteSubresourcesMeta`](/definitions#routesubresourcesmeta) registered by an
[`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) decorator by using the
[`getRouteSubresourcesMetadata`](/definitions#getroutesubresourcesmetadata) function.
