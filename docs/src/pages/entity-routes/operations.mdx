title: Operations

import { DocAlert } from "@/components";

There are two kinds of _operations_ : [`RouteOperation`](/definitions#routeoperation) and
[`GroupsOperation`](/definitions#groupsoperation).

## RouteOperation

```typescript
// Used by @EntityRoute decorator
// they defines which routes are availables
type RouteDefaultOperation = "create" | "list" | "details" | "update" | "delete";
type RouteOperation = RouteDefaultOperation | string;
```

For basic _operations_, a [`RouteOperation`](/definitions#routeoperation) defines which
[**RouteController**](/definitions/classes/routecontroller) method will be used for a specific route. The basic
[**groups**](/entity-routes/groups/) are those that you know well, the [CRUD](/definitions#groupsoperation) ones.

For [custom actions](/docref), any string can be used to make your own specific
[`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope).

## GroupsOperation

```typescript
// Used by @Groups decorator
// they define in which context a property is exposed
type GroupsOperation = "create" | "list" | "details" | "update" | string;
type GroupsOperationOrShortcuts = GroupsOperation[] | "all" | "basic";
```

## Shortcuts

There are two shortcuts available for @Groups decorator : "all" and "basic".

-   "all" litteraly means no matter which operations, the property decorated will be exposed.
-   "basic" means every basic [`CRUD_OPERATIONS`](/definitions#const-crud_operations) :
    `[create, list, details, update]`

<DocAlert status="info">

Each [`GroupsOperation`](/definitions#groupsoperation) match one from [`RouteOperation`](/definitions#routeoperation),
except `delete` since there is no property exposed in a DELETE route response.
