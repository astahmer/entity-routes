import { DocAlert } from "@/components";

There are two kinds of operations : [`RouteOperation`](globals#routeoperation) and [`GroupsOperation`](globals#groupsoperation).

## RouteOperation

```typescript
// Used by @EntityRoute decorator
// they defines which routes are availables
type RouteDefaultOperation = "create" | "list" | "details" | "update" | "delete";
type RouteOperation = RouteDefaultOperation | string;
```

For basic operations, a RouteOperation defines which [**RouteController**](/api-reference/classes/routecontroller) method will be used for a specific route.
The basic groups are those that you know well, the [CRUD](/api-reference/globals#groupsoperation) ones.

For [custom actions](/docref), a custom operation (any string) can be used to make your own specific [`route scope`](/route-scope/).

## GroupsOperation

```typescript
// Used by @Groups decorator
// they define in which context a property is exposed
type GroupsOperation = "create" | "list" | "details" | "update" | string;
type GroupsOperationOrShortcuts = GroupsOperation[] | "all" | "basic";
```

## Shortcuts

There are two shortcuts available for @Groups decorator : "all" and "basic".

-   "all" litteraly means no matter which operations, the property decorated will be exposed.
-   "basic" means every basic [`CRUD_OPERATIONS`](globals#const-crud_operations) : `[create, list, details, update]`

<DocAlert status="info">

Each [`GroupsOperation`](globals#groupsoperation) match one from [`RouteOperation`](globals#routeoperation), except `delete` since there is no property exposed in a DELETE route response.
