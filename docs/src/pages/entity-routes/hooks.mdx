title: Hooks
---

If you need to alter some part of the request handling, there are hooks available.
These hooks are basic functions receiving different arguments that will help you change or make something happens when called.

> Possible hooks are [before/after][handle/?:(clean/validate/persist)/?:(read/format)/respond]

```typescript
type HookSchema = Partial<{
    /**
     * Called right after the requestContext has been set by the appropriate middleware &
     * right before the request is handled by the response middleware
     */
    beforeHandle: HookFnOnHandle;
    // Called after the request has been handled
    afterHandle: HookFnOnHandle;

    // Called right before the response status & body are set
    beforeRespond: HookFnOnRespond;
    // Called right after the response status & body are set
    afterRespond: HookFnOnRespond;

    // Called right before cleaning an entity from database
    beforeClean: HookFnBeforeClean;
    // Called right after cleaning an entity from database
    afterClean: HookFnAfterClean;

    // Called right before the validation of the request body
    beforeValidate: HookFnBeforeValidate;
    // Called right after the validation of the request body
    afterValidate: HookFnAfterValidate;

    // Called right before persisting payload from the request body
    beforePersist: HookFnBeforePersist;
    // Called right after persisting payload from the request body
    afterPersist: HookFnAfterPersist;

    // Called right before reading an item or a collection from database
    beforeRead: HookFnBeforeRead;
    // Called right after reading an item or a collection from database
    afterRead: HookFnAfterRead;

    // Called right before removing (or softDelete entity/unlink subresource) an entity from database
    beforeRemove: HookFnBeforeRemove;
    // Called right after removing (or softDelete entity/unlink subresource) an entity from database
    afterRemove: HookFnAfterRemove;
}>;
```

You can pass a [`HookSchema`](globals#hookschema) in the `hooks` key of the options (EntityRouteOptions docref) argument,
available when making entity routers (using [`makeEntityRouters`](globals#makeentityrouters)) or directly in the `@EntityRouter` (docref).
