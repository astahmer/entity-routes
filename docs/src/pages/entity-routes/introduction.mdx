While browsing the documentation, if you feel like an example is missing, feel free to check the
[`tests`](https://github.com/astahmer/entity-routes/tree/main/tests) folder to see the actual usage of the feature you
were reading about.

</DocAlert>


## Motivation

Basically this is a **Node / Typescript** route handler [tightly coupled\*](#future) with
**[TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/)** entities.

I wanted to get rid of writing the same boring controllers again & again for each entities and I could not find a NodeJS
project that would fit my needs : being simple enough not to require any configuration (or controllers), yet easily
customizable when needed.

## Main Features

-   Instant CRUD with a simple [`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) decorator
-   [Granular control over which properties are exposed](/groups/introduction) (with [`@Groups`](/definitions#groups))
    in which route scope
-   [`Subresources`](/entity-routes/subresources): Entity properties that have dedicated endpoints, can be nested
-   Independant service components (Database [`Reader`](/definitions/classes/reader), `Persister`,
    [`RelationManager`](/definitions/classes/relationmanager) etc...)
-   Built-in powerful [`filters`](/filters) for lists (`Search`/`Pagination`) that should fit well for 99% use cases
-   [Custom filters](/filters/custom-filter) if you find yourself in the 1%
-   [`Hooks`](/entity-routes/hooks) to alter a request handling at any point in the process
-   Built-in validation using
    [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)/[entity-validator](https://github.com/astahmer/entity-validator)
    decorators on your entities
-   Inferred entity route mappings (with generated endpoints to get the summary of an entity exposed properties for each
    contexts)
-   [Computed properties](/entity-groups/groups/computed-property): methods, possibly async, exposed as properties
-   [`@MaxDepth`](/definitions#maxdepth) decorator for entity/properties
-   Optimized SQL queries with only exposed properties selected
-   Soft delete/restoration supported (also for Subresources)
-   Standardized REST [responses](/entity-routes/response-format)

## Perks

-   0 config required
-   Type-safe API
-   Almost complete code coverage (95%+)
-   Out-of-the-box support for Koa/Express (therefore Next, Nuxt) integrations and compatible and any other
    middleware-based framework using adapters
-   Everything (types included) is exported so you can use it your own way

## Future

`entity-routes` is tightly coupled with TypeORM for now. In the long-term I'd like to make it an ORM-independant
library. Something like supporting ORM through different packages, like `@entity-routes/typeorm`,
`@entity-routes/mikro-orm`, etc.

Same could be done for routers (`@entity-routes/koa`, `@entity-routes/express`), rather than use the current
[`ContextAdapter`](/definitions#contextadapter).
