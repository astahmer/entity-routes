An entity for `entity-router` is nothing more than a TypeORM entity. We only expects you to implement the [`GenericEntity`](/api-reference/interfaces/genericentity) interface on every entities used.

Please refer to the `TypeORM` documentation about how to make [entities](https://typeorm.io/#/entities).

## Creating your entities

```typescript {3}
interface GenericEntity {
    [k: string]: any;
    id: string | number;
}
```

Nothing fancy here, there is only one constraint :

<DocAlert status="info">
    You must have an `id` property always exposed on all your entities used by EntityRoute.
</DocAlert>

So a minimal implementation should look at least like this :

```typescript {2,4}
export class AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("all")
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
}
```

And then you would make all your entities `extends` from this one,
[just like any other class inheritance with Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html).
You can learn more about TypeORM table inheritance [here](https://typeorm.io/#/entity-inheritance).

## Creating an EntityRouter

The [`@EntityRoute`](/api-reference/globals#entityroute) decorator creates an
[`EntityRouter`](/api-reference/classes/entityrouter) on the decorated [entity](https://typeorm.io/#/entities/what-is-entity).

<DocAlert>
    The name distinction is to avoid any conflict between the service (EntityRouter) and the decorator (EntityRoute).
</DocAlert>

Example :

```typescript {1}
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: ["create", "update", "details", "list", "delete"] })
@Entity()
export class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    name: string;
}
```

It takes two arguments, both optional. _[Complete definition here](/api-reference/globals/entityroute)._

The first argument ([EntityRouteArgs](/api-reference/globals#entityrouteargs)) defines **your routes**.

-   a string `path`, which will be the root path for all routes on that entity.
    **Path should start with a "/".**
-   an array of `operations`, which will enable matching CRUD actions.
    For example, adding `create` operation will lead to having a `POST:/users` route in the example above.

<DocAlert>
    When no path is specified, it defaults to the entity name. With the example above on User entity, the base path
    would be equal to "/user"
</DocAlert>

The second argument ([EntityRouteConfig](/api-reference/globals#entityrouteconfig)) defines the options passed to every routes on that entity.

<DocAlert>
    When no args are passed, the EntityRoute is registered to be used by others as a Subresource but generates no routes
    for its own entity.
</DocAlert>

If you don't wan't to write all operations everytime you just need to import & use [CRUD_OPERATIONS](/api-reference/globals#const-crud_operations).
It looks like this.

```typescript
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS })
```

## Usage

After you have decorated every entities for which you want to create an [**EntityRouter**](/api-reference/classes/entityrouter)
and exposed their properties (with the [@Groups](/api-reference/globals#groups) decorator),
you must register your routes on your node application.

Any implementation of the makeXXXEntityRouters should wrap the [makeEntityRouters](/api-reference/globals#makeentityrouters),
so the arguments to pass ([MakeEntityRouters](/api-reference/globals#makeentityrouters)) should remain the basically the same :

-   connection: [TypeORM Connection](https://typeorm.io/#/connection)
-   entities: an array of every entities that you decorated with [`@EntityRoute`](/api-reference/globals#entityroute) and for which you want its [`EntityRouter`](/api-reference/classes/entityrouter) to be used
-   options: [EntityRouteOptions](/api-reference/globals#entityrouteoptions), [defaults](/api-reference/globals#const-defaultentityrouteoptions)

```typescript title="Example with a Koa API"
const app = new Koa();
const bridgeRouters = await makeKoaEntityRouters({ connection, entities, options });
bridgeRouters.forEach((router) => app.use(router.instance.routes()));
```

## Route options

Here are the options available :

```typescript collapsable
type EntityRouteOptions = {
    /** Is max depth enabled by default on all entities for any request context for this router */
    isMaxDepthEnabledByDefault?: boolean;
    /** Default level of depth at which the nesting should stop for this router */
    defaultMaxDepthLvl?: number;
    /** In case of max depth reached on a relation, should it at retrieve its id and then stop instead of just stopping ? */
    shouldMaxDepthReturnRelationPropsId?: boolean;
    /** In case of a relation with no other mapped props (from groups) for a request: should it unwrap "relation { id }" to relation = id ? */
    shouldEntityWithOnlyIdBeFlattenedToIri?: boolean;
    /** Should set subresource IRI for prop decorated with @Subresource */
    shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem?: boolean;
    /** Default level of subresources max depth path */
    defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl?: number;
    /** Default CreateUpdateOptions */
    defaultCreateUpdateOptions?: CreateUpdateOptions;
    /** Allow soft deletion using TypeORM @DeleteDateColumn */
    allowSoftDelete?: boolean;
    /** When true, list/details will also select softDeleted entities */
    withDeleted?: boolean;
    /** Hook schema of custom functions to be run at specific operations in a request processing */
    hooks?: HookSchema;
};
```

There are multiple stages where you can set an [`EntityRouteOptions`](/api-reference/globals#entityrouteoptions).

1. You can set global options for your `entity-routes` by passing them to [`makeEntityRouters`](/api-reference/globals#makeentityrouters) (or an implentation of it such as [`makeExpressEntityRouters`](/api-reference/globals#makeexpressentityrouters)) options key.
2. You can then override the global options by passing a custom options object to the [`@EntityRoute`](/api-reference/globals#entityroute) decorator as 2nd argument.
3. If you directly use a component's (such as [`RouteController`](/api-reference/classes/routecontroller), [`Reader`](/api-reference/classes/reader) or any other) method you can also pass just the options that are needed locally

You can retrieve the [`RouteMetadata`](/api-reference/globals#routemetadata) registered by an [`@EntityRoute`](/api-reference/globals#entityroute) decorator by using the [`getRouteMetadata`](/api-reference/globals#getroutemetadata) function.
