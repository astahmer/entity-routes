title: Subresources
---

It's a way to generate a dedicated endpoint for an entity property.

Let's say you have a `User` entity that owns a collection of `articles`.
Rather than exposing the `articles` in the `/users` route and have a lot of unnecessary nested data,
you might want to directly access the article list with only the properties you want for that [`route scope`](/route-scope/).

By decorating the `articles` property with the [@Subresource](/api-reference/globals#subresource) decorator, you generates 3 routes :

-   `GET:/users/:userId/articles`, which will list all articles of the given user
-   `POST:/users/:userId/articles`, which will allow you to join an article to this user (a new article is inserted if no article id is given !)
-   `DELETE:/users/:userId/articles/:articleId`, which will allow you to remove the relation between the given user/article

```typescript {7}
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS })
@Entity()
class User {
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    articles: Article[];
}
```

Of course, you can customize your Subresource using [SubresourceOptions](/api-reference/globals#subresourceoptions) as optional second argument.

Subresources are nestable by default, so you could have a `GET:/users/:userId/articles/comments` by making article.comments a subresouce as well.
