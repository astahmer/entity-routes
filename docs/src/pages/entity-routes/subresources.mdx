import { DocAlert, SubresourcePlayground } from "@/components";

It's a way to generate a dedicated endpoint for an entity property.

Let's say you have a `User` entity that owns a collection of `articles`. Rather than exposing the `articles` in the
`/users` route and have a lot of unnecessary nested data, you might want to directly access the `article` list with only
the properties you want for that [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope).

By decorating the `articles` property with the [@Subresource](/definitions#subresource) decorator, you generates 3
routes :

-   `GET:/users/:userId/articles`, which will list all `articles` of the given `user`
-   `POST:/users/:userId/articles`, which will allow you to join an `article` to this `user` (a new `article` is
    inserted if no `article`.id is given !)
-   `DELETE:/users/:userId/articles/:articleId`, which will allow you to remove the relation between the given
    `user`/`article`

Let's implement that :

```typescript {7,11}
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS })
@Entity()
class User {
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    articles: Article[];
}

@EntityRoute()
@Entity()
class Article {
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    articles: Article[];
}
```

<DocAlert status="warning">

For an entity to be used as a Subresource, it **must have an [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter)**
registered. And if you don't want to generates CRUD routes, you can just provide no arguments to
[`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) just like the example above.

</DocAlert>

Of course, you can customize your Subresource using [SubresourceOptions](/definitions#subresourceoptions) as optional
second argument.

| Option key    | Type                                                        | Default                                   | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| operations    | [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation) | `["create", "list", "details", "delete"]` | Defines which routes should be generated for this subresource  |
| maxDepth      | number                                                      | undefined                                 | Restrict the depth of subresources nesting allow from this one |
| canHaveNested | boolean                                                     | true                                      | Allow this subresource to have nested child subresources       |
| canBeNested   | boolean                                                     | true                                      | Allow this subresource to be used as a child subresource       |

<DocAlert status="info">

-   By just specifying "create" as [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation), only the
    `POST:/users/:userId/articles` would be generated. You get the idea, this works the same for others operations.
-   A single relation should use the `details` [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation) whereas a
    collection should use the `list` [`SubresourceOperation`](/definitions#subresourceoperation).

</DocAlert>

## Nesting

Subresources are nestable by default, so you could have a `GET:/users/:userId/articles/comments` by making
`Article.comments` a subresource as well. And if you're crazy enough, nothing stops you from nesting further with a
`GET:/users/:userId/articles/comments/upvotes`, etc.

<DocAlert status="info">

The [`defaultEntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#const-defaultentityrouteoptions) (passed to the
[`makers`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker)) has a `defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl: 2`.

</DocAlert>

### Max depth

You can control the max depth using the maxDepth key of [SubresourceOptions](/definitions#subresourceoptions). Each
maxDepth is independant from each other. If no max depth is defined, it will fallback to the
`defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl` of `EntityRouteOptions`, and if somehow no `defaultSubresourceMaxDepthLvl` is defined,
it will default to 2.

## Playground

Feel free to play with the playground below to experience how max depths works.

The routes are intentionnaly not all added initially, you can add them yourself by adding a route using the "+" button
next to the entity name tags, and then selecting each subresource properties you want in your routes.

Or you can just click on "Generate all possible routes" and see each possibilities for the config defined above. You can
also hover on the warning icon to see the reason why the subresource can not be nested further.

## Single relation subresource

The example above and most use-cases of subresources will be for collection relation
([`OneToMany`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-one-one-to-many-relations)/[`ManyToMany`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-many-relations)).
But sometimes you might want a single relation
([`OneToOne`](https://typeorm.io/#/one-to-one-relations)/[`ManyToOne`](https://typeorm.io/#/many-to-one-one-to-many-relations))
to be a subresource.

There is actually no difference in usage between single/collection subresources but here's an example for the sake of
it.

Let's say you have a `User` entity that is linked with a `config` relation. Rather than exposing the `config` in the
`/users` route and have a lot of unnecessary nested data, you might want to directly access the config with only the
properties you want for that [`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope).

By decorating the `config` property with the [@Subresource](/definitions#subresource) decorator, you generates 3 routes
:

-   `GET:/users/:userId/config`, which will show you the `config` of the given `user`
-   `POST:/users/:userId/config`, which will allow you to join a `config` to this `user` (a new `config` is inserted if
    no `config`.id is given !)
-   `DELETE:/users/:userId/config`, which will allow you to remove the relation between the given `user`/`config`

## Subresources formating in response

With the [`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions) key `shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem`, the corresponding
subresources IRI are added for each items having subresources (without exposing them through
[`@Groups`](/definitions#groups)).

<DocAlert status="info">

The [`defaultEntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#const-defaultentityrouteoptions) (passed to the
[`makers`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker)) has a `shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem: true`.

</DocAlert>

Using the same example from above with User/Article, here's how that would look like :

```typescript
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS }, { shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem: true })
@Entity()
export class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups({ user: ["create", "details"], article: ["list"] })
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}

@EntityRoute()
@Entity()
export class Article extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    title: string;

    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    content: string;

    @Groups("basic")
    @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.articles)
    author: User;
}
```

Response on user details :

```json {6} bottomLeft="GET:/users/1" bottomRight="A link to the articles subresource"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": "/api/users/1/articles",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```

And that's what would happen if you exposed properties from that subresource relation (with
[`@Groups`](/definitions#groups)):

```typescript {3} minimal
class User {
    // ...
    @Groups("basic")
    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}
```

Response on user details route with `User.articles` exposed :

```json
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": [
        {
            "author": "/api/users/1",
            "content": "Lorem ipsum",
            "id": 1,
            "title": "First article"
        }
    ],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```
