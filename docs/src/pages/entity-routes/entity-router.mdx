title: EntityRouter
---

An entity for `entity-router` is nothing more than a TypeORM entity.

<Info>

Please refer to the [`TypeORM`](http://typeorm.io/) documentation on how to make
[`entities`](https://typeorm.io/#/entities).

</Info>

There are 3 steps to make and use an [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter).

## 1. Creating your entities

Every `entities` used by `entity-routes` should have an `id` property exposed through any
[`route scope`](/entity-routes/route-scope/), so that they properly implement the
[`GenericEntity`](/definitions/interfaces/genericentity).

```typescript {3} slug="generic-entity" withoutLang
interface GenericEntity {
    [k: string]: any;
    id: string | number;
}
```

So a minimal implementation should look at least like this :

```typescript {2,4}
export class AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("all")
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
}
```

And then you would make all your entities `extends` from this one,
[just like any other class inheritance with Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html). You
can learn more about [`TypeORM`](http://typeorm.io/) table inheritance [here](https://typeorm.io/#/entity-inheritance).

## 2. Creating an EntityRouter

The [`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) decorator creates an [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter)
on the decorated [entity](https://typeorm.io/#/entities/what-is-entity).

<Info>

The name distinction is to avoid any conflict between the service ([`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter))
and the decorator (`EntityRoute`).

</Info>

Example :

```typescript {1}
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: ["create", "update", "details", "list", "delete"] })
@Entity()
export class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    name: string;
}
```

It takes two arguments, both optional. _[Complete definition here](/definitions#entityroute)._

The first argument ([EntityRouteArgs](/definitions#entityrouteargs)) defines **your routes**.

-   a string `path`, which will be the root path for all routes on that entity. **Path should start with a "/".**
-   an array of [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/), which will enable matching CRUD actions. For example,
    adding `create` [**operation**](/entity-routes/operations/) will lead to having a `POST:/users` route in the example
    above.

<Info>
    When no path is specified, it defaults to the entity name. With the example above on User entity, the base path
    would be equal to "/user"
</Info>

The second argument ([EntityRouteConfig](/definitions#entityrouteconfig)) defines the options passed to every routes on
that entity.

<Info>
    When no args are passed, the EntityRoute is registered to be used by others as a Subresource but generates no routes
    for its own entity.
</Info>

If you don't wan't to write all basic [**operations**](/entity-routes/operations/) everytime you just need to import &
use [CRUD_OPERATIONS](/definitions#const-crud_operations). It looks like this.

```typescript
@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: CRUD_OPERATIONS })
```

## 3. Usage

After you have decorated every entities for which you want to create an
[**EntityRouter**](/definitions/classes/entityrouter) and exposed their properties (with the
[@Groups](/definitions#groups) decorator), you must register your routes on your node application.

### Maker

Any [`maker`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker) should wrap the [makeEntityRouters](/definitions#makeentityrouters), so
the arguments to pass ([MakeEntityRouters](/definitions#makeentityrouters)) should remain the basically the same :

-   connection: the [TypeORM Connection](https://typeorm.io/#/connection) used
-   entities: an array of every entities that you decorated with [`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) and for
    which you want its [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter) to be used
-   options: [EntityRouteOptions](/definitions#entityrouteoptions), an object of global options that will be passed down
    to all [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter)
    ([defaults](/definitions#const-defaultentityrouteoptions))

```typescript bottomRight="Example with a Koa API"
const app = new Koa();
const bridgeRouters = await makeKoaEntityRouters({ connection, entities, options });
bridgeRouters.forEach((router) => app.use(router.instance.routes()));
```

There are 2 built-in makers: [`makeKoaEntityRouters`](/definitions#makekoaentityrouters) &
[`makeExpressEntityRouters`](/definitions#makeexpressentityrouters).

If your Node framework doesn't support classic middleware syntax (Express-like with `(req, res, next) => void` or
Koa-like with `(ctx, next) => void`), you can make your own [`maker`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker/) with your own
custom [`ContextAdapter`](/definitions#contextadapter). TODO link

## Route options

Here are the options available :

```typescript collapsable
type EntityRouteOptions = {
    defaultMaxDepthOptions?: JoinAndSelectExposedPropsOptions;
    /** Default ListDetailsOptions, deep merged with defaultEntityRouteOptions */
    defaultListDetailsOptions?: ListDetailsOptions;
    /** Default CreateUpdateOptions, deep merged with defaultEntityRouteOptions */
    defaultCreateUpdateOptions?: CreateUpdateOptions;
    /** Default subresources options, deep merged with defaultEntityRouteOptions */
    defaultSubresourcesOptions?: SubresourceMakerOptions;
    /** Default subresources options, deep merged with defaultEntityRouteOptions */
    defaultWriterOptions?: WriterOptions;
    /** Allow soft deletion using TypeORM @DeleteDateColumn */
    allowSoftDelete?: boolean;
    /** Hook schema of custom functions to be run at specific operations in a request processing */
    hooks?: HookSchema;
    /** Middlewares to be pushed before requestContext middleware */
    beforeCtxMiddlewares?: Function[];
    /** Middlewares to be pushed after requestContext middleware */
    afterCtxMiddlewares?: Function[];
};
```

There are multiple stages where you can set an [`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions).

1. You can set global options for your `entity-routes` by passing them to
   [`makeEntityRouters`](/definitions#makeentityrouters) (or an implentation of it such as
   [`makeExpressEntityRouters`](/definitions#makeexpressentityrouters)) options key.
2. You can then override the global options by passing a custom options object to the
   [`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) decorator as 2nd argument.
3. If you directly use a component's (such as [`RouteController`](/definitions/classes/routecontroller),
   [`Reader`](/definitions/classes/reader) or any other) method you can also pass just the options that are needed
   locally

## Metadata

You can retrieve the [`RouteMetadata`](/definitions#routemetadata) registered by an
[`@EntityRoute`](/definitions#entityroute) decorator by using the [`getRouteMetadata`](/definitions#getroutemetadata)
function.
