Middlewares are functions that process the request, chained one by one, which make them very easy to re-use. Using
middlewares you can handle authentication, logging, permissions, etc.

A middleware has access to the [`req`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) and the
[`res`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) objects from the
[Node http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html). If using `afterCtxMiddlewares`, you also get access to the route
[`RequestContext`](/definitions#requestcontext).

Learn more about them from [Koa's documentation](https://github.com/koajs/koa) or from
[Express's documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

## Usage

You can add middlewares to an [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter) by passing them in the
[`EntityRouteOptions`](/definitions#entityrouteoptions), which means that you can both register a local middleware for a
specific [`EntityRouter`](/definitions/classes/entityrouter) or register global middlewares by passing them to the
[`makeEntityRouters`](/definitions#makeentityrouters).

The implementation itself of a middleware will depend of the [`maker`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker) used.

-   If you use Koa, you can use the [`makeKoaEntityRouters`](/definitions#makekoaentityrouters)
    [`maker`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker).
-   If you use Express or a compatible API (Next, Nuxt, etc.), you can use the
    [`makeExpressEntityRouters`](/definitions#makeexpressentityrouters) [`maker`](/entity-routes/introduction#maker).

A basic middleware looks like this :

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Koa</Tab>
    <Tab>Express</Tab>
  </TabList>

  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>

```typescript title="Example taken from https://koajs.com/"
const logMw = async (ctx, next) => {
    const start = Date.now();
    await next();
    const ms = Date.now() - start;
    ctx.set("X-Response-Time", `${ms}ms`);
};
```

</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>

```typescript title="Example taken from https://expressjs.com/fr/guide/using-middleware.html"
const timeMw = function (req, res, next) {
    console.log("Time:", Date.now());
    next();
};
```

</TabPanel>

  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

## Differences with [**hooks**](/entity-routes/hooks/)

If you want to intervene at some point of the request handling (and potentially alter part), you might want to check
[**hooks**](hooks) rather than using middlewares.

They differ from middlewares since they do not receive the context/req/res arguments but rather just the relevant parts
of what they are dedicated to.

Middlewares are more powerful, they can for example end the request handling and send a response, whereas
[**hooks**](/entity-routes/hooks/) can at most alter their part.
