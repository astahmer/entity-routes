title: Route response
---

Each `entity-routes` response will be formated using a template defined by the route **operation** , either `list` or
`details`. All responses will share the `@context` part nonetheless.

Here the actual ts type (`RouteResponse`) :

```ts
type RouteResponse = {
    "@context": {
        /** Current route operation */
        operation: string;
        /** Current entity's route */
        entity: string;
        /** Total number of items found for this request */
        totalItems?: number;
        /** Number of items retrieved for this request */
        retrievedItems?: number;
        /** Entity validation errors */
        validationErrors?: EntityErrorResults;
        /** Global response error */
        error?: string;
    };
    /** List of entities */
    items?: any[];
    /** deleted entity id */
    deleted?: any;
    /** Entity props */
    [k: string]: any;
};
```

## @context

-   `operation`/`entity` keys are always added and define the `route scope`
-   On a `persist` [**operation kind**](/entity-routes/groups/definitions#operation-kind), either `create` or `update`,
    the `validationErrors` key will be added and defaults to an empty array.
-   On a `read` [**operation kind**](/entity-routes/groups/definitions#operation-kind), either `list` or `details`, the
    `totalItems`/`retrievedItems` keys will be added and defaults to empty arrays.
-   The `error` key is only added when there is an error, it is populated with the error message caught.

## Auto reload

You can avoid making another request on the entity `details` route (`GET:/xxx/123`) to get the latest recorded state
after an entity was persisted using auto-reloading.

On `persist` operations (`create`/`update`), after the entity was successfully saved, it can be auto-reloaded using the
`shouldAutoReload` key of the `CreateUpdateOptions` object, passed to the `create`/`update` methods of
`RouteController`.

When an entity is auto-reloaded, it is read from the database using the `getDetails` method of `RouteController`, so
that the response is returned the exact same way as if it was requested through the `details` route (`GET:/xxx/123`).
The **operation** used is either defined explictly by using the `responseOperation` key of the `CreateUpdateOptions`
object, or defaults to `details` elsewise.

> By default, it is enabled since the `defaultEntityRouteOptions` object has a `defaultCreateUpdateOptions` key set to
> `{ shouldAutoReload: true, shouldFormatResult: true }`.

## Format

Response are formated using the `Formater`, itself called in the `getDetails`/`getList` methods of `RouteController`.
That means auto-reloaded entities are also formated.

The formater process each response item/items and perform the following tasks :

-   Remove any object that is not another Entity (object that implements `GenericEntity`) or is not a Date
-   Flatten item with only id if needed (and if `shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem` of `EntityRouteOptions` is true)
-   Set subresources IRI if item has any (and if `shouldSetSubresourcesIriOnItem` of `EntityRouteOptions` is true)
-   Add computed properties to this item
-   Sort item's property keys

> By default, it is enabled since the `defaultEntityRouteOptions` object has a `defaultCreateUpdateOptions` key set to
> `{ shouldAutoReload: true, shouldFormatResult: true }`.

## Examples

### Create/update

```json bottomLeft="POST:/users/"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "create",
        "entity": "user",
        "validationErrors": null
    },
    "articles": [],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```

### List

```json bottomLeft="GET:/users/"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "list",
        "entity": "user",
        "retrievedItems": 1,
        "totalItems": 1
    },
    "items": ["/api/users/1"]
}
```

### Details

```json bottomLeft="GET:/users/1"
{
    "@context": {
        "operation": "details",
        "entity": "user"
    },
    "articles": [],
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alex"
}
```
