A very common need for APIs is to filter a list through different conditions.

Filters receive query parameters to determine which conditions to apply, and the current request queryBuilder onto which
apply them.

They are registered using decorators on either an @Entity or a property.

## Built-ins

There are 2 basic filters built-in, both extending the [`AbstractFilter`](/definitions/classes/abstractfilter) :

-   [`SearchFilter`](/definitions/classes/searchfilter), used with the `@Search decorator`, allows you to search using a
    [`StrategyType`](/definitions#strategytype)
-   [`PaginationFilter`](/definitions/classes/paginationfilter), used with the `@Pagination decorator`, allows you to
    paginate and order the results

| Filter           | Decorator   | Specific options                                                     | Default options getter           |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| AbstractFilter   | none        | all/allShallow/allNested                                             | none                             |
| SearchFilter     | @Search     | defaultWhereStrategy                                                 | getSearchFilterDefaultConfig     |
| PaginationFilter | @Pagination | defaultOrderBys / defaultOrderDirection / defaultRetrievedItemsLimit | getPaginationFilterDefaultConfig |

If neither of them satisfies your need, you can always make your own custom filter by extending the
[`AbstractFilter`](/definitions/classes/abstractfilter).

## Enabling properties

> You will need to explicitly enable the properties you want to be filterable, else the corresponding query parameters
> will be ignored.

With the [`AbstractFilter`](/definitions/classes/abstractfilter) class, you can quickly define which properties will be
filterable. To do so, you need to set its options ([`DefaultFilterOptions`](/definitions#defaultfilteroptions))
accordingly or/and by passing an array of property paths ([`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty)).

> By passing a dot delimited string, you can filter on a (deeply?) nested relation property

### Allowing a set of properties

Using the [`DefaultFilterOptions`](/definitions#defaultfilteroptions), you can allow every properties of a specific kind
to be filtered.

```ts
type DefaultFilterOptions = {
    /** Make all property paths filtereable by default */
    all?: boolean;
    /** Make all (not nested) properties filterable by default */
    allShallow?: boolean;
    /** Make all nested property paths filtereable by default */
    allNested?: boolean;
};
```

An example with the [`@Search`](/definitions#search) filter would look like this :

```ts
@Search({ all: true })
```

### Explicitly allow properties

You can directly pass an array of [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty), which is an array of property/nested
property path.

```ts
@Search(["id", "firstName", "role.identifier"])
```

### Using both

```ts
@Search(["id", "firstName"], { allNested: true })
```

## Metadata

You can retrieve the [`RouteFiltersMeta`](/definitions#routefiltersmeta) registered by an filter decorator (such as
[`@Search`](/definitions#search), [`@Pagination`](/definitions#pagination) or [`@OrderBy`](/definitions#orderby)) by
using the [`getRouteFiltersMeta`](/definitions#getroutefiltersmeta) function.
