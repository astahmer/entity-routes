## Make your entities

You're just going to have to create your TypeORM entities just like you always did. Then there are 2 @ decorators that
are specific to entity-routes :

-   **@EntityRoute** which is a class decorator, must be placed at the top of it so that your entities can be exposed
    through an EntityRouter.
-   **@Groups** which is a property decorator, must be placed at the top of every properties you want to expose through
    your routes, more details on it later

Here is a simple example.

```typescript collapsable
export class AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("all")
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
}

@EntityRoute({ path: "/users", operations: ["create", "update", "details", "list", "delete"] })
@Entity()
export class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Subresource(() => Article)
    @OneToMany(() => Article, (article) => article.author)
    articles: Article[];
}

@EntityRoute()
@Entity()
export class Article extends AbstractEntity {
    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    title: string;

    @Groups("basic")
    @Column()
    content: string;

    @Groups("basic")
    @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.articles)
    author: User;
}
```

It will automatically generate those routes :

| Verb   | Path                                  | Name                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| POST   | /users                                | user_create          |
| POST   | /users/mapping                        | user_create_mapping  |
| PUT    | /users/:id(\d+)                       | user_update          |
| PUT    | /users/:id(\d+)/mapping               | user_update_mapping  |
| GET    | /users/:id(\d+)                       | user_details         |
| GET    | /users/:id(\d+)/mapping               | user_details_mapping |
| GET    | /users                                | user_list            |
| GET    | /users/mapping                        | user_list_mapping    |
| DELETE | /users/:id(\d+)                       | user_delete          |
| POST   | /users/:UserId(\d+)/articles          | user_articles_create |
| GET    | /users/:UserId(\d+)/articles          | user_articles_list   |
| DELETE | /users/:UserId(\d+)/articles/:id(\d+) | user_articles_delete |

## Register your Entity Routes

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Koa</Tab>
    <Tab>Express</Tab>
  </TabList>

  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>

```typescript {8,14}
import { AddressInfo } from "net";
import { makeKoaEntityRouters } from "@entity-routes/koa";
import * as Koa from "koa";
import * as bodyParser from "koa-bodyparser";
import { Connection } from "typeorm";
export async function setupKoaApp(connection: Connection) {
    const entities = connection.entityMetadatas.map((meta) => meta.target) as Function[];
    const bridgeRouters = await makeKoaEntityRouters({ connection, entities, options });

    const app = new Koa();
    app.use(bodyParser());

    // Register all routes on koa server
    bridgeRouters.forEach((router) => app.use(router.instance.routes()));

    const server = app.listen(); / random port
    const baseURL = `http://127.0.0.1:${(server.address() as AddressInfo).port}`;

    return { baseURL, server };
}
```

import { AddressInfo } from "net";
import { makeExpressEntityRouters } from "@entity-routes/express";
import * as bodyParser from "body-parser";
import * as express from "express";
import { Connection } from "typeorm";
export async function setupExpressApp(connection: Connection) {
    const entities = connection.entityMetadatas.map((meta) => meta.target) as Function[];
    const bridgeRouters = await makeExpressEntityRouters({ connection, entities, options });

    const app = express();
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

    // Register all routes on Express server
    bridgeRouters.forEach((router) => app.use(router.instance));

    const server = app.listen(); / random port
    const baseURL = `http://127.0.0.1:${(server.address() as AddressInfo).port}`;

    return { baseURL, server };
}

## Final step

That's it. There is no final step. Your routes are ready.
