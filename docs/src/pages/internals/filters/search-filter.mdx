title: SearchFilter
---

import { DocAlert } from "@/components";

The `SearchFilter` allows you to filter efficiently a list of items with several [common SQL operators](#strategies)
(such as `=`, `IN`, `EXISTS`, `LIKE`, etc) using [readable query parameter keys](#basic-usage). You can filter on
[nested relations/properties](#relations) with [complex conditions](#complex-conditions).

## Decorator

You can register a SearchFilter on an entity using the [`@Search`](/definitions#search) decorator.

You can directly pass an array of [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty), which is an array of property/nested
property path or a tuple of property/nested property path with a specific default [`StrategyType`](#strategies). This
list contains the `filterable properties`.

Each [`StrategyType`](#strategies) will allow you to filter a property through different conditions.

> You can use any [`StrategyType`](#strategies) on a filterable property. Specifying one for a property path in the
> [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) list just sets it as the default strategy to use for that property
> path and allows you to omit it in query parameters.

Example of use with a property, a property path with another `defaultWhereStrategy` and another global
`defaultWhereStrategy` for that `@Entity` :

```typescript
@Search(
    ["firstName", ["role.identifier", "CONTAINS"]],
    { defaultWhereStrategy: "STARTS_WITH" }
)
```

In this example the `firstName` property will default to `STARTS_WITH` unless it is overriden by specifiying another
[`StrategyType`](/definitions#strategytype) directly in the request, whereas the `role.identifier` property will default
to `CONTAINS` strategy, unless overriden directly in the request.

</DocAlert>

## Basic Usage

Once you have enabled the properties you want to filter, you can use them as query parameters on `list` operation for
that `@Entity`.

On a `User` entity, by enabling only the `firstName` and `role.identifier` properties :

```typescript
class AbstractEntity {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
}

@Entity()
class Role extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    identifier: string;
}

@Search(["firstName", ["role.identifier", "CONTAINS"]], { defaultWhereStrategy: "STARTS_WITH" })
@Entity()
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    firstName: string;

    @ManyToOne(() => Role)
    role: Role;
}
```

With these query parameters :

```json
{ "id": "123", "firstName": "Alex", "role": "789", "role.identifier": "abc456" }
```

On the request: `GET:/users/?id=123&firstName=Alex&role=789&role.identifier=abc456`

Only the `firstName` & `role.identifier` query parameters will be used as filtered since they alone were explicitly
specified on @Search `filterable properties`.

`firstName` strategy is `STARTS_WITH` since it is the `defaultWhereStrategy` given in options and `role.identifier`
strategy is `CONTAINS` since it was provided in properties (in [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) tuple).

## Strategies

These strategies can be used both as `defaultWhereStrategy` or directly in query parameter with the
[advanced syntax](#advanced-usage).

| StrategyType          | Shortcut | SQL generated                         | Inverse SQL                             |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| EXACT                 | none     | prop = value                          | !=                                      |
| IS                    | none     | prop IS value                         | IS NOT                                  |
| IN                    | none     | prop IN value                         | NOT IN                                  |
| EXISTS                | none     | prop IS NOT NULL                      | IS NULL                                 |
| CONTAINS              | none     | prop LIKE %value%                     | NOT LIKE %value%                        |
| STARTS_WITH           | none     | prop LIKE value%                      | NOT LIKE value%                         |
| ENDS_WITH             | none     | prop LIKE %value                      | NOT LIKE %value                         |
| BETWEEN               | <\>      | prop IS BETWEEN value                 | IS NOT BETWEEN                          |
| BETWEEN_STRICT        | ><       | (valueMin > prop AND prop < valueMax) | (valueMin <= prop AND prop >= valueMax) |
| LESS_THAN             | <        | prop < value                          | >=                                      |
| LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL    | <\|      | prop <= value                         | prop > value                            |
| GREATER_THAN          | >        | prop > value                          | <=                                      |
| GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL | >\|      | prop >= value                         | prop < value                            |

> If you're wondering why `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL` and `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL` use the `|` instead of `=` character, it's
> because the `=` is already used to define the limit between the query parameter key and value.

### Multiple values

If you need to filter on the same [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) and
[`StrategyType`](/definitions#strategytype) but with different values, you can use comma-separated values as query param
value. Then each of these values will be trimmed and then wrapped in the same SQL condition with a `OR` conditions for
each value.

<DocAlert status="info">

Passing an array of values to a query parameter with the strategy `EXACT` will be the same as using the `IN` strategy.
Conversely, if you use the `NOT` operator by appending a `!` to the query parameter key, the `EXACT` with multiple
values will end up with the same results as a `NOT IN`.

</DocAlert>

<DocAlert status="info">

`BETWEEN_STRICT` is the only strategy that always requires exactly 2 values. Example: `{ "id><": "3, 8" }` or
`{ "role.id;betweenStrict": "3, 8" }`

</DocAlert>

## Relations

-   You can filter a relation property by enabling a [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) on its dot
    delimited path. Example: `abc.def.ghi`
-   You can filter on a relation by either enabling as [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) the relation
    itself or by appending `.id`. Example: `{ "role": 123 }` is the same as `{ "role.id": 123 }`
-   There is no limit to the nesting, be careful with the SQL performance of every LEFT JOIN made if you nest too far

## Advanced usage

Since any `StrategyType` is available for a `filterable property`, sometimes you might want to use another one than the
default one. To do so you just need to use the strategy part of the `advanced syntax`.

There is a syntax for query parameters keys that makes filters very powerful. There are 4 parts to a
[`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) query parameter. Each part name is wrapped with parenthesis below (for
readability, there are no parenthesis in usage) :

> `(complex condition)(propertyPath)(;StrategyType|shortcut)(!)`

1. `complex condition`: **Optional.** The complex condition part might be used if you have advanced needs, it allows you
   to nest and group conditions with the `and`|`or` operators. [More details here.](#complex-conditions)
2. `propertyPath`: Using a dot delimited string, you can target a (`shallow`|`deeply nested`) (`relation`|`property`) to
   filter on.
3. `StrategyType|shortcut`: **Optional.** The StrategyType name (can be written camelCased or as UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE)
   prepended by a colon or just the shortcut (without the colon) if there is any available.
4. `!`: **Optional.** The NOT operator, by appending a `!` to a query parameter key, the StrategyType will be inversed.

### Quick example

Below is an example which makes no actual sense whatsoever, still, it remains valid and would produce the following
query.

With these query parameters :

```json
{
    "id!": "123",
    "id;greaterThan!": "456",
    "owner.id!": "789,321,654",
    "and(key0):owner.role.identifier": "admin",
    "and(key0):owner.role.name;endsWith": "@gmail.com",
    "or(key1):owner.birthDate<>": "1996-01-01T00:00:00, 2000-01-01T00:00:00",
    "or(key1)and(nestedKey2):owner.id>": "987",
    "or(key1)or(nestedKey2):owner.email;STARTS_WITH!": "abc"
}
```

A query would be produced looking like this :

```sql
SELECT ... from teams team
LEFT JOIN users team_owner ON team.owner_id = users.id
LEFT JOIN roles team_owner_role ON team_owner_role.id = team_owner.role_id
WHERE
    team.id != 123
AND team.id <= 456
AND team_owner.id NOT IN (789, 321, 654)
AND (
        team_owner_role.identifier = "admin"
    AND team_owner_role.name LIKE '%@gmail.com'
)
OR (
        (team_owner.birthDate BETWEEN "1996-01-01T00:00:00" AND "2000-01-01T00:00:00")
    AND (
            team_owner.id > 987
        OR team_owner.email NOT LIKE 'abc%'
    )
)

```

### Full example

```typescript
class AbstractEntity {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
}

@Entity()
class Role extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    identifier: string;
}

@Search({ all: true })
@EntityRoute({ operations: ["list"] })
@Entity()
class User extends AbstractEntity {
    @Column()
    firstName: string;

    @ManyToOne(() => Role)
    role: Role;
}
```

> On the `user.list` route scope (`GET:/users/`): Using `all: true`, you can filter on any property path from the `User`
> entity. Here the default strategy used for every [`FilterProperty`](/definitions#filterproperty) is `EXACT` since it's
> the global default one and none were specified on the @Search decorator.

| Filter description                       | Query parameter key                                       | Query parameter value |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Get all users with ids in list [1, 2, 3] | `id`                                                      | `1,2,3`               |
| Get all users with role equal to 111     | `role` or `role.id`                                       | `111`                 |
| Get all super_admin users                | `role.identifier`                                         | `super_admin`         |
| Get all admin users                      | `role.identifier;endsWith` or `role.identifier;ENDS_WITH` | `_admin`              |

### Complex conditions

At some point, you might need to have more complex conditions to filter your list, requiring the SQL `OR` operator, or
with maybe some `nested conditions`. That is possible using the `complex conditions` syntax.

All you need for that is to prefix your condition with the `and` or `or` condition operator. When you have nested
conditions you should append a `condition identifier` wrapped in parenthesis after the `condition operator`
(`and`|`or`). That `condition identifier` can be any string you want, as long as you re-use the same consistently for
the same conditions you want to nest.

You can chain them indefinitely and add as much nested conditions as you want. It is recommended to use names that makes
sense to make the query parameter key almost readable like an english sentence.

<DocAlert status="info">

You can omit the `and` operator, though you it is recommended to explicitly write it for readability. Example:
`or(isAdmin)and(aboveId):id>` = `or(isAdmin)(aboveId):id>`

</DocAlert>

#### Example

_Using the [same entities as the example above](#full-example)._

For these query parameters :

```json
{
    "id!": 123,
    "or(isAdminNotSuperOrNameLike)and:role.identifier;contains": "admin",
    "or(isAdminNotSuperOrNameLike)and:role.identifier!": "super_admin",
    "or(isAdminNotSuperOrNameLike)or:firstName;startsWith": "Alex"
}
```

You would have that query generated :

```sql
SELECT ... from users user
LEFT JOIN roles user_role ON user_role.id = user.role_id
WHERE
    user.id != 123
OR (
    user_role.identifier LIKE '%admin%'
    AND user_role.identifier != "super_admin"
    OR user.firstName LIKE 'Alex%'
)

```

#### Full example

> To get all users with first name that starts with "Alex" that are either in the list [1, 2, 3] or that are admin and
> with an id above 50 but not super_admin unless his first name is "Max" or "Nath". (Yes this is a complete unrealistic
> demand, I just needed an example of a complex query.)

The query parameters would look like this :

```json
{
    "id": "1,2,3",
    "firstName;startsWith": "Alex",
    "or(isAdmin)and(aboveId):role.identifier;endswith": "_admin",
    "or(isAdmin)and(aboveId):id>": "50",
    "or(isAdmin)or(notSuperOrInList):role.identifier!": "super-admin",
    "or(isAdmin)or(notSuperOrInList)or:firstName": "Max, Nath"
}
```

> Reminder: The complex condition names `(isAdmin)` and `(aboveId)` are completely arbitrary, you just need to use the
> same string when you want to nest conditions.

And the `SearchFilter` would generate a query like :

```sql
SELECT ... from users user
LEFT JOIN roles user_role ON user_role.id = user.role_id
WHERE
    user.id IN (1,2,3)
AND user.firstName LIKE 'Alex%'
OR (
    (
            user_role.identifier LIKE '%_admin'
        AND user.id > 50
    )
    OR (
            user_role.identifier != "super_admin"
        OR user.firstName IN ("Max", "Nath")
    )
)

```

## Default config

You can get the default [`SearchFilter`](/definitions/classes/searchfilter) using the
[`getSearchFilterDefaultConfig`](/definitions#getsearchfilterdefaultconfig) function. It can be used for example to
retrieve the `defaultWhereStrategy` inside the `options` key.
